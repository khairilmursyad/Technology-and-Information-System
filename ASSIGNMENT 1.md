Reflection:
Creating this poster about the industrial visit was both educational and rewarding. It allowed me to consolidate key insights from the visit and creatively present them in a visually engaging format. I gained a deeper understanding of effective visual communication, ensuring that complex information is conveyed in a concise and appealing manner.
This task also sharpened my design skills, from selecting the right color schemes to placing content strategically for maximum impact. One of the challenges was balancing text and visuals to maintain a clean yet informative layout. Overcoming this taught me the importance of prioritizing key information and using infographics where possible.
Additionally, summarizing the knowledge gained from the industrial visit helped reinforce my learning about industry practices, the latest technologies, and professional expectations. The project further enhanced my teamwork, research, and presentation skills.
Looking back, I am proud of the final poster and the effort put into it. I would be more mindful of using advanced design tools and templates in future projects to elevate the overall quality.
