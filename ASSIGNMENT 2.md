Reflection on Creating a Video for UTM Digital Visit :
Making a vlog about our visit to UTM Digital was a unique and insightful experience. It allowed me to document the key highlights of the visit creatively while practicing video production skills. Capturing moments in real time helped convey the excitement and valuable insights gained during the tour.
One of the challenges was balancing between being fully present during the visit and capturing footage for the vlog. Ensuring that the shots were steady, well-lit, and engaging required careful planning and attention. Editing the footage was another critical learning point â€” selecting the best clips, adding transitions, music, and text overlays to make the video more dynamic.
Through this project, I improved my storytelling skills, learning how to sequence content to maintain viewers' interest. Additionally, it enhanced my technical skills in video editing software and content creation techniques.
This experience highlighted the importance of clear communication and thoughtful content structuring. Moving forward, I aim to improve audio quality and explore more creative angles to make future vlogs even more engaging.
